**Note:** Unfortunately, Surfline has change their frontend so that edits to the DOM (updating the class names of certain HTML elements) cause a refresh of the page. This makes the extension obsolete.

Reveal the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Days for Forecasts on Surfline

## More Info

Surfline's Regional Forecasts only show the next two days and the last four days are blurred out (unless you pay for Premium; Premium does include more than six days). These other days are hidden and blurred but the data is actually there.

With a little magic from ForecastGenie, we can see those extra days!
